Overview
============

Here is my neovim config, it is configured to make coding easier and faster.

## Installation

- [Neovim Installation](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim)
Do not install example config when you install finish.

Make sure to backup your current config. Then clone this repository to `~/.config/nvim`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Dudeiebot/nvim ~/.config/nvim
```

This will also install Lazy automatically. Now just open Neovim and run `:Lazy`. 
Lazy help install all the plugin automatically and you can add more customs plugin in the custom directory.

You may need to clone some config like go-imports reviser  and add them to your go bin, you may have them already but Lazy will tell you to install them if they are not available
